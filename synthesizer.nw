this is the code optimization part

@ 
this is the part of the code that will actually generate the code. It is one of the phases
for compilation. For our purposes we do not need this phase because our intermediate code 
will be the same as our output code. The reason this part is still here is because if we 
decided to add a semi state for the code to be, we would not have to change the structure 
of the code.

<<code generation>>=
/*
  @param1 intermediateCode = This is the intermediate code
  return = the final html code that is needed after the compilation
  
  currently the intermediate code is the same as the final code, this function is still here
  to ensure that if we wanted to add a state for the code before html we could with ease

/*

*/
function convert(syntaxTree){
  var intermediateCode = intCodeGen(syntaxTree);
  intermediateCode = codeOptimization(intermediateCode);
  return codeGeneration(intermediateCode);
}


@
this is the part of the code that will be public. For the purposes of our code we made 
the convert, the only function that will be public. The reason we chose this is because 
the other functions are not needed from any other file.

<<api>>=
module.exports.convert = convert;


@
this is the output of the program, The makefile works in a manor where the filename is root
of the project. So when this part of the code gets compiled, it will creater the proper code
